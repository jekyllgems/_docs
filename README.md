# Jekyllgems Documentation

This is the main documentation repo for all Jekyllgems repos. If there are more specific documentation that applies to the plugin or theme directly it is included in the repo for that project. These docs cover the main things like Code of Conduct, Contributing Guide, and Changelog information. If you have ideas for plugins you would like to see created, please start a new thread in the [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/jekyllgems/discussions) and select "Gems" as the category. Feel free to join the discord server linked on the main page of the org and jump in on discussions. As projects grow and people contribute they can add their names to the `.github/MEMBERS/contributors.md` file and username and icon will be displayed on the main page.
